 * \brief glasscore hypocenter class
 *
 * The CHypo class is the class that encapsulates everything necessary
 * to represent an earthquake hypocenter.
 *
 * CHypo also maintains vectors of shared_ptr's to CPick and CCorrelation
 * objects that make up the data that supports the hypocenter
 *
 * CHypo contains functions to support association, disassociation, location,
 * removal, and various statistical calculations, as well as generating
 * output data in various formats.
 *
 * The CHypo associate() and prune() functions essentially make up
 * the glasscore data association engine, along with the various statistical
 * calculations.
 *
 * The glasscore location algorithm consists of the CHypo anneal(), localize(),
 * annealingLocateBayes(), annealingLocateResidual(), calculateBayes(), and
 * calculateAbsResidualSum() functions, along with the various statistical
 * calculations.
 *
 * CHypo uses smart pointers (std::shared_ptr).
